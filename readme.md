 ## Net health report for R developers
 
This is a Shiny app that reports the status of web applications that are commonly used by R developers. Essentially it will check code repositories (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab) and CI services (Travis, AppVeyor) to see if they're operational.

The main audience would be R developers. Often when I get an error on GitHub or a CI service like Travis, I want to know if the problem is my code or if the service is broken for R packages. Instead of searching a bunch of different sources to figure this out, I'd like a central place to check everything. 

This is what, the Net health report for R developers will do.
